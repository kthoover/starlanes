# starlanes
Starlanes is a universe (actually just a galaxy) created for game playing and learning of javascript and HTML5.

The galaxy is made up of star systems (current numsys = 20) and their associated planets.

Currently, most of the data in the program is random as everything is still in the early development stage.

Each system is connected to other systems by a number of one way portals, which are accessed by clicking on them.
The portals leaving a system are represented by clockwise spining disks.  Counterclockwise spining disks enter the system.

As a player travels through the starlanes they learn to map the connections and learn about systems they visit.

The bluish rectangle present on many screens is the control pannel icon.  Clicking it takes you to the main control pannel.

Clicking on the sun icon displays the stars and planets in the current system.  System 0 is the Sol system.

Clicking on the portal icon displays the portals in the current system.

Clicking on the table icon displays a table of all the known systems and their connecting starlanes.

The starship icon currently does nothing.

When a player is looking at the stars and planets in a system they can be visited by clickin on one of them.

When a player visits a star or planet they can interact with it and any inhabitants.

Currently, only the buy functionality is partially working.  Clicking on the buy line will bring up the transaction screen.
(hopefully, I will have at least this part done by the end of the weekend.)
